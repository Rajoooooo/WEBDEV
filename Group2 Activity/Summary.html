    <h1> Summary</h1>
    <details>
        <summary>In ancient Japan, a monkey-man, who earned a living by showcasing his monkey's tricks, decides to sell the old monkey to the butcher because it forgets its tricks. The monkey overhears the plan and seeks advice from a wise boar in the forest. The boar suggests a clever scheme: he will temporarily snatch the master's baby, causing a commotion, and the monkey must then rescue the child. The plan works perfectly. The boar takes the baby, causing panic, and the monkey heroically retrieves the child, earning the gratitude of the family. When the butcher arrives, the family decides not to sell the monkey, and he lives peacefully for the rest of his days, no longer subjected to mistreatment.
